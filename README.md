## Description

This logo maker is simple and easy to use and can be used by anyone who is knowledgable at all about the terminal. By running node index in the terminal, the user will be asked a series of questions which will then create an svg file in the output folder. By following the path of that file in the browser, the user will be able to access the logo they created.
